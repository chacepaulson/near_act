*Data Under Consideration:* 

Shot Spotter - gun shot detection, acoustic surveillance technology that uses sensors to detect, locate, and alert law enforcement agencies of potential gunfire incidents in real time. 

Stop Data - includes "stop and frisk" data, "vehicle stop" data, "pedestrian stop" data, and "bicycle stop" data

Arrest Data - adult arrests made by the MPD from 2013 to 2017, each row denotes one arrest and not one charge

Crime Statistics (Citywide) - official crime index for D.C. from 2013 to 2016

Homicide Closure Rates - data runs from 2003 to 2017


*Data to Investigate:*

FBI Crime Data Explorer - data derived from incident-based and summary reports, have not yet located the appropriate data set to utilize from the set, arrest and use-of-force data should be coming out soon as well 

District Crime Data at a Glance - look into the degree to which this data differs from previously recorded data
